Codeable WooCommerce Etsy Product
==========================

Installation
-------------
WooCommerce must be installed first, for this plugin to function.

Copy the plugin into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory, and then login to your WP Admin, go to `Plugins` , find `Codeable WooCommerce Custom Etsy Product Field` and click `Activate`

Usage
-------------
Once activated, visit `WooCommerce -> Settings`, and then click on the `Products` tab. Underneath that, click on `Codeable - Etsy Product Settings`. You'll see a screen where you can enter your Etsy API Key, and your Etsy Shop Name. An Etsy API key can be created from [Etsy's developer center](https://www.etsy.com/developers/register). A key and a shop name have been pre-filled for you for convenience.

Now we can create an Etsy Product. Click on the `Products` section in the admin sidebar, and then either click `Add Product`, or click on an existing product. On the edit screen, you will see a `Product Data` dropdown. From there, you can select `Codeable - Etsy Product`

Once selected, you will see two fields to configure your product. The first field says `Pick an Etsy Item`. This field is populated with the items in your Etsy shop, and chosing one will link that Etsy listing to your WooCommerce product. The image, title, price, and description are all pulled from [etsy.com](http://etsy.com), so there is no need for you to enter that information yourself.

The second field allows you to pick a time to `Cache for faster displaying`. Selecting one of these values will speed up your page load time, at the expense of possibly having an outdated version of your product appear on your page.
